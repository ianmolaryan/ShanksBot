ShanksBot

ShanksBot is a Java-based project that explores the fascinating mathematical phenomenon of prime reciprocals and their non-repeating decimal digits.

Inspiration

This project is named after the 19th-century mathematician William Shanks, who is famous for his meticulous work in calculating the decimal expansions of prime reciprocals by hand. Shanks dedicated much of his life to these computations, paving the way for a deeper understanding of decimal periodicity and number theory long before modern computational tools were available.

About ShanksBot

ShanksBot calculates the number of non-repeating digits in the decimal expansion of the reciprocal of prime numbers. Given any prime number, the bot outputs the count of unique, non-repeating digits before the cycle begins. This project highlights the intricate structure of prime reciprocals and sheds light on patterns that continue to intrigue mathematicians. Basically it would do the same thing with the prime numbers given to it as what William Shanks would have done but in seconds (check it out yourself, there is a time counter for each iteration of the program).




Features

* Calculates the decimal expansion of the reciprocal for any given prime.
* Counts non-repeating digits in the expansion.
* Designed with clean, efficient Java code for easy extensibility and readability.
* OpenSource(would love contributions??)




Why This Project?

Prime numbers are fundamental in mathematics due to their unique properties and applications in areas such as cryptography and signal processing. Inspired by William Shanks' dedication to uncovering the secrets of prime reciprocals, this project brings his work into the digital age, making it accessible and interactive for enthusiasts and students alike.
