  <b>A Java-powered bot exploring prime reciprocals and their hidden decimal secrets! 🔢✨</b>
</p>

---

## 🌟 Inspiration

This project is inspired by **William Shanks**, a mathematician who manually computed decimal expansions of prime reciprocals. I first came across this concept through **Matt Parker's** video, where he showcased a Python-based ShanksBot. Being a Java enthusiast, I decided to create my own version! 🚀

## 🔍 What is ShanksBot?

ShanksBot is a **Java-based tool** that analyzes the decimal expansion of prime reciprocals and calculates the **number of unique, non-repeating digits** before the decimal cycle begins.

### 🔥 Key Features
✅ Computes the decimal expansion of **any prime number** 🔢  
✅ Counts **non-repeating digits** before the cycle starts ⏳  
✅ Efficient and **lightweight Java implementation** 🚀  
✅ **Open-source!** Contributions are welcome! 🤝

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

```bash

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ianmolaryan/ShanksBot_java.git
cd ShanksBot


# Compile & Run
javac ShanksBot.java
java ShanksBot

```

## 📌 Example Output

```bash
Enter a prime number: 66851
Prime number: 66851
Precision used: 133702
Length of repeating part: 66850
Calculation execution time: 0.8301201 seconds
```

## 📅 Roadmap
📌 Add a **GUI version** for a more interactive experience 🎨  
📌 Implement a **Python version** 🐍  
📌 Enhance performance for larger primes 🚀
