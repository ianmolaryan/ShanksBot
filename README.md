# ShanksBot

ShanksBot is a Java-based project that delves into the captivating mathematical phenomenon of prime reciprocals and their non-repeating decimal digits.

## Inspiration

This project is named after the 19th-century mathematician William Shanks, renowned for his meticulous calculations of the decimal expansions of prime reciprocals by hand. Shanks devoted much of his life to these computations, paving the way for a deeper understanding of decimal periodicity and number theory long before the advent of modern computational tools.

I was inspired to create this project after watching a video by the Australian mathematician Matt Parker, who explored the same topic and showcased his own ShanksBot, developed in Python. Intrigued by the concept, I resolved to create my own version in Java. During my research, I discovered that there were few similar implementations available. As an Electronics major student from Bengal, India, my curiosity and passion for mathematics and programming compelled me to embark on this journey and build a fresh, new bot from scratch.

## About ShanksBot

ShanksBot calculates the number of non-repeating digits in the decimal expansion of the reciprocal of prime numbers. Given any prime number, the bot outputs the count of unique, non-repeating digits before the repeating cycle begins. This project highlights the intricate structure of prime reciprocals and sheds light on patterns that continue to fascinate mathematicians. Essentially, it replicates what William Shanks would have done manually, but in mere seconds (try it yourself—there’s even a time counter for each iteration of the program!).

## Features

* Computes the decimal expansion of the reciprocal for any given prime number.
* Counts the non-repeating digits in the expansion.
* Written in clean, efficient Java code, ensuring easy extensibility and readability.
* Open-source and welcoming contributions from the community!

## Why This Project?

Prime numbers hold a special place in mathematics due to their unique properties and their applications in fields such as cryptography and signal processing. Inspired by William Shanks' dedication to uncovering the secrets of prime reciprocals, this project brings his work into the digital age, making it accessible and interactive for enthusiasts and students alike.

Moreover, combining mathematics and coding is an exhilarating experience—what more could one ask for?
